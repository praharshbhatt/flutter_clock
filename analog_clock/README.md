The watch face inspires us to tell a story of the time in the most precisive and perfect way, while being simple and minimal at the same time, just like the draftsmen before us, highlighting the importance of measuring time and it's significance.



This watch face is designed tobe simple enough to accurately tell the time.
The markings in the watch face are based on measuring instruments.
